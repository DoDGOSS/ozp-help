<p>As an organizational steward, the Listing Management page displays information about listings you own and listings you oversee. The Listing Management page displays different information for different users. The following sections explain each field as it relates to org stewards. For the user view see <Link to="article" params={{
  part: 'global',
  article: 'Center_listingManagementPage_user',
  title: 'Manage your Created Listings'
}}>Manage your Created Listings</Link>.</p>

<p>The left-side State panel provides slightly different information than a user's or Center steward's left-side panel:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>All</b> - Listings you oversee as a steward</li>
	<li><b>Published</b> - Listings that are approved by Center and organizational stewards within your organization (this number includes listings that are Disabled)</li>
	<li><b>Needs action</b> - Listings waiting for your approval. For instructions regarding approving or returning listings see <Link to="article" params={{

	<li><b>(Pending) Org approved</b> - Listings waiting for Center steward approval</li>
	<li><b>Returned</b> - Listings returned to their owners</li>
	<li>Draft - Listings in the system that have not been submitted for approval</li>
</ul>
